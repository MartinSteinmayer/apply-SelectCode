# Trello Clone

### A project management tool inspired by Trello, built using NestJS, Supabase, React, and TailwindCSS.

## Features

- User authentication and registration.

- Create, update and delete projects.

- Add and manage tasks

- Add comments to tasks

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Supabase account

## How to Run the Code

Go to the root directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# Run docker-compose
docker-compose up --build
```

That should be it! The app should be running on http://localhost:8080!

Disclaimer: This is a work in progress. The docker compose does not work properly still do to CORS issues that i could not resolve. I will be working on this in the future. If you want to see the app in action, you can run the backend and frontend separately (installing the dependencies and then running each in its own terminal).
