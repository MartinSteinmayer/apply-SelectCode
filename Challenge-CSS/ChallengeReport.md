### Solution (if applicable)

I have made a simple replica of the Figma design using HTML,CSS and a bit of JavaScript.


### Approach

I have a bit more experience using HTML and CSS in comparassion to backend development using frameworks such as NestJS so the approach was pretty straightforward: I implemented the design features with simple css and for the responsivness i used media queries and flexbox. I also used a bit of JavaScript to make the menu button work.


### Learnings

It was a good opportunity to practice my CSS skills and to refresh my memory about flexbox and javascript.
