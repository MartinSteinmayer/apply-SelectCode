# Challenge Report for Martin Steinmayer

## Challenge Name: NestJS

### Status

Please update the status of the challenge:

- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] Partially Completed
- [ ] Fully Completed

*(Check the box that applies to your status)*

### Solution (if applicable)

If your challenge involves providing a text-based answer, please write it here. For coding challenges, include a link to
your code repository or a brief description of your solution.

*Example: "Created a convolutional neural network model for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras"*

### Approach

I started by reading the NestJS documentation and following the tutorial. I then created a new project and implemented
the required endpoints. I used the NestJS CLI to generate the boilerplate code for the endpoints. I used the NestJS
documentation to learn how to use the CLI and implement the endpoints. 

*Example: "Used ChatGPT to research different methods for computer vision challenges, then implemented a solution based
on a paper found through Google Scholar. Also used OpenCV documentation for image preprocessing."*

### Learnings

Share what you learned during the challenge. What was new? What surprised you? Did anything challenge your preconceived
notions?

I had to learn a lot about NestJS and how to use it. I had never used NestJS before, so I had to learn how to use it and how to
develop it together with docker and postgres. I am sure it is not the best solution, but i tried to do my best.

*Example: "Learned about different image preprocessing techniques in OpenCV. Surprised by the effectiveness of dropout
layers in reducing overfitting. Challenged by the computational resources required for training large neural networks."*
