### Solution (if applicable)

I wrote a NestJS and Postgresql API that can be run with docker-compose and implements all the required endpoints.


### Approach

I started by reading the NestJS documentation and following the tutorial. I then created a new project and used the NestJS CLI to generate the boilerplate code for the required endpoints. I then setup docker and postgresql, which was a bit confusing in the beginning. ChatGPT helped me a lot, especially with debugging and writing test cases, although they were not as complete as i would want in an actual project (still dont really know how to simulate event listeners in testing).

### Learnings


I learned a lot. I had never used NestJS and Postgresql before, so I had to learn how to use it and how to
develop it together with docker. I am sure it is not the best solution, but i tried to do my best.
