### Solution (if applicable)

I wrote a small React web application that simulates a simplified chess game.

### Approach

I already knew a bit about React and that made it easier for me to find information, whether it was on the official documentation or ChatGPT. The latter also helped me a lot with structuring my project and giving me directions as to what components I should use and how to use them. I wrote two additional components besides the App component: one Board component and one Square component. I implemented most of the app logic on the App component itself, utilizing mainly Hooks.

### Learnings

I learned a lot about React, a technology that I was not so proficient with. At first it took a while to understand the principles and logic behind react, such as props, components and state, but as I went on I got to understand it better.
