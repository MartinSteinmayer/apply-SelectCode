### Solution (if applicable)

Solutions are on the Answers.md file.

### Approach

I had a lot of help from chatGPT, especially for debugging and explaining concepts, but the code it gave me was quite buggy so i had a lot of problems to solve haha. To solve those problems i read the documentation and tried to find useful information on other websites.

### Learnings

I learned a lot about kubernetes, a technology that i had never used before. It was quite a challenge because the concepts are quite difficult to grasp but as i went on i got to understand a bit of the logic behind it.
